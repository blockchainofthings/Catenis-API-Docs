# Client libraries

To make it easier for developers to interact with the Catenis Enterprise API and overcome the hurdles of authenticating each request, Blockchain of Things provide open-source client libraries for different programming languages and environments.

The following libraries are currently available:

* [JavaScript (for Web browsers)](https://github.com/blockchainofthings/CatenisAPIClientJS)
* [Node.js](https://github.com/blockchainofthings/CatenisAPIClientNodeJS)
* [PHP](https://github.com/blockchainofthings/CatenisAPIClientPHP)
* [C++](https://github.com/blockchainofthings/CatenisAPIClientCpp)
* [Node-RED](https://github.com/blockchainofthings/CatenisAPINodeRed)

###Paw extensions

Aside from the Catenis API client libraries listed above, Blockchain of Things have also made available a set of customized [Paw extensions](https://paw.cloud/extensions?q=Catenis) that can be used to facilitate the creation and use of Catenis API requests from within [Paw](https://paw.cloud) on a Mac, allowing for easy prototyping and testing of the Catenis Enterprise API methods.
