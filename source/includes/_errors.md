# Errors

Catenis Enterprise uses conventional HTTP response status codes to indicate the general outcome of an API request.

## HTTP status codes

The following HTTP status codes are returned by the Catenis Enterprise API.

| Status&nbsp;code | Explanation |
| ---------- | ------- |
| 200 | OK - The request succeeded. |
| 400 | Bad Request - The request could not be processed the way it was, and should be changed before it is resubmitted. |
| 401 | Unauthorized - The request requires user authentication, or authorization has been refused for the supplied credentials. |
| 403 | Forbidden - The request cannot be fulfilled. |
| 413 | Payload Too Large - The data sent with the request is too large and cannot be processed. |
| 500 | Internal Server Error - The server encountered an unexpected condition which prevented it from fulfilling the request. |
| 503 | Service Unavailable - The server is currently unable to handle the request. |

<aside class="warning">
Any returned status code different than <b>200</b> indicates an error when processing an API request.
